Where the concepts of peace and brotherhood are alien, then religion must be a guise for showmanship. Use scriptures, follow them, at least to become instruments of harmony with all living entities. Or, don’t use scripture and still be instruments of harmony, simply because it makes intrinsic sense. What we do know is that this planet and humans, people who plant your food, nurse your sick, give you the gift of company. The idea of a peaceful, loving God, whose followers agitate here on Earth in the hope of securing a place with this divine form? Ironic. From belittling to killing, what to justify and what to abhor? Surely the expectation of God should be more than that of a broker? M. Govender Durban Daily News  Do you have something on your mind; or want to comment on the big stories of the day?
