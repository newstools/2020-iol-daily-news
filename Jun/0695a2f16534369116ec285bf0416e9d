The virus is deadly and will maximise any opportunity to wreak its havoc. Despite the best practices adopted in hospitals, we are still seeing high levels of infection at such institutions. If medical facilities cannot contain the virus, we must know that physical distancing and hand sanitising in places of worship is unlikely to present a significant deterrent to the virus. A task team, comprising religious elders and members of the health sector, should provide guidance beyond the regulations to ensure the safety of our worshippers and mitigate the spread of the virus. My humble appeal is to consider delaying the opening of religious places and for people to pray at home.
