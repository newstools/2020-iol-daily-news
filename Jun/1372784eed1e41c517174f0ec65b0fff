Brijmohan said the porridge was sponsored by Amapelepele spices.  "Residents still need help. Last week we delivered a truck load of groceries including bread and milk to the needy in the area. Some have menial jobs. Many have not returned to work. Many have been retrenched. These residents are on our database. The main aim is to encourage other businesses to help the needy in this trying time where a lot families are on verge of starvation,"he said. Last week, ward 90 in Isipingo received food hampers. The Paris informal settlement, Orient Hills top flats received 250 hampers each.The Pelgrim informal settlement received  hampers for the 400 families that reside there.  Non-governmental organisations like Black Sash and Pietermaritzburg Economic Justice and Dignity (PEJD) are equally concerned about the economic plight of poor people in South Africa. They believe the government needs to top up social grant payments and provide a basic income grant to struggling households. “It’s so difficult because people are saying that hunger is going to kill us long before the coronavirus. The question is what is the nearest threat? Hunger is closer, but people are very serious about the virus and nervous as well,” PEJD lead researcher Julie Smith said. Daily News
