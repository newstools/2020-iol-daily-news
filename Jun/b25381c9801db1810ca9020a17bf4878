The driver and one passenger died while the other is recovering in hospital. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said it was alleged that the dead were involved in a KwaDabeka murder and attempted murder on February 8. “On Monday, three victims were shot by unknown people. A 30-year-old sustained multiple shot wounds on the body and was certified dead at the scene,” she said. IOL reported that police confirmed the alleged hit was taxi-related. Mbele said the three men were seated in the Golf when they were approached by armed men who fired several shots at them. “Police responded to a shooting on the R102 bridge near Duffs Road. On their arrival they were shown the bodies of two men lying inside the vehicle with multiple gunshot wounds to the head and body. The third victim was grazed by a bullet on the head and taken to hospital,” said Mbele. The driver died at the scene while the second man died a short while later. Those who knew the men were shocked at the video posted on social media of the three men’s bodies riddled with bullets, and bloodied. “Someone showed the video to my child and she’s still not good. She’s 11 years old,” posted a Facebook user. Meanwhile, police are closing in on a wanted suspect in the province linked to a number of cases including murders, attempted murders, armed robbery and escaping from custody. On social media the name Sibongakonke Phiwayinkosi Mbatha / Buthelezi from Gabadela area, Ezibayeni and a picture were shared with the headline “Most Wanted Suspect”. After police were questioned about the cases against the man in Empangeni, Melmoth, Kokstad and Nongoma, Mbele said a detective task team had been formed to co-ordinate all the cases where the suspect was wanted in KZN. “Unfortunately, we cannot divulge more information as the investigation is at a sensitive stage.” Daily News
