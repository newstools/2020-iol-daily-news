I am asking this specific question, not forgetting what Covid-19 has done to the job market. In recent times, we have witnessed big business profits shrinking and followed by many restructures to contain costs. In addition, these have resulted in unintended consequences that gave rise to companies laying off a sizeable percentage of their workforce. The current situation is making it difficult to sustain significant inroads in reducing the unemployment figures. It is not going to be easy to find opportunities for the youth seeking meaningful employment. This is because most companies will be likely downsizing or adopting innovative business models to ensure their sustainability and to remain competitive. The key question remains: is this unemployment bubble going to be reversed, and at what cost? I am saying this because of the increasing numbers of unemployed youth in South Africa. This is especially true for the 15-24 age group. I am imagining a South Africa that has moved boldly in having its own self-styled Silicon Valley. A suitable place where aspiring entrepreneurs can be supported and develop their unique business ideas. I think such an action will help in reducing unemployment.
