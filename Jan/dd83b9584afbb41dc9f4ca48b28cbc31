The Daily News reported that an official was caught on camera at a fast food outlet, allegedly stealing a cellphone. The video shows the man, who was at the front of the queue, looking around and proceeding to steal what looked like a cellphone from the counter. A few seconds later he made his escape. The video went viral on Twitter, being retweeted more than 2000 times on the Twitter page of crime-fighter and social cohesion activist Yusuf Abramjee. The store had customers inside but they were not aware of what happened. Howard Dembovsky, chairperson of Justice Project SA, said: “(The police) think they are above the law.” He said corruption within law enforcement would not change because of a lack of consequence management of people who had done wrong.
