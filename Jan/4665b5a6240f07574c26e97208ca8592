#BHOVAMANIA üêï A post shared by  AKA (@akaworldwide) on Jan 28, 2020 at 8:02pm PST  Everyone keep preaching ‚ÄúFind your person, show them off and if it fails, find another one and do the same‚Äù but when AKA move from Zinhle, Bonang, Zinhle to this suddenly it‚Äôs a crisis lol. https://t.co/1NijM7K9Gb   The way you defend these celebs ngathi ayaniphakela. Zinhle is living her life she is busy making money while you wasting your data fighting for her Relationship pic.twitter.com/QataQ5AkzK   I hate how every time Zinhle trends, it has to do with her love life. That lady is one of the best business women in the entertainment industry, I wish we could learn a lot about how she has grown her brand.  Konje DJ Zinhle once told us that her daughter will be proud of matured parentsAKA is embarrassing her AGAIN pic.twitter.com/aXDrfXHfia This is a plubicity stunt , a guy who recently was saying being a father is everything to him doing this now to his baby mama who he just recently got back together with. I smell something here. But ke pic.twitter.com/0AJM2lGwom Tjooooo!!! The level of disrespect for the mother of your child though. wonder what your child will think when she's old enough to understand how you chose to repeatedly publicly humiliated her mom. pic.twitter.com/QMWJxdPwmU When are you gonna grow up
