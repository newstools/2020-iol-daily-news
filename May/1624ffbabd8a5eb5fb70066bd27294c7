On 31 December 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported a cluster of pneumonia cases in Wuhan City, China. ‘Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2’ (SARS-CoV-2) was confirmed as the causative agent of what we now know as ‘Coronavirus Disease 2019’ (COVID-19). Since then, the virus has spread to more than 100 countries, including South Africa. As of Monday, May 25, the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases in South Africa was 23 615. KwaZulu-Natal has 1 882 cases. A total of 596 777 tests have been conducted to date. Covid-19 related deaths brings the total national deaths to 481. The number of recoveries stands at 11 917. In KwaZulu-Natal there were 49 deaths and 1 168 recoveries. There is no need to panic, according to health officials as 82% of Covid-19 cases are mild: patients only experience a slight fever, fatigue and a cough. Only about 6% of patients need intensive care. The vast majority of people can stay at home and get better without hospital treatment. Daily News
