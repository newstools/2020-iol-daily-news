With Covid-19, fatalities could increase dramatically should the current pace of death accelerate on a much larger scale. According to computer simulations based on historical data, there will be 60million deaths this year, the largest medical killer being 18million from heart disease. Covid-19’s current postulated trajectory is expected to result in 4million global deaths. Air pollution is the biggest killer of human beings on the planet, according to a recent study by the European Society of Cardiology. It is a proven fact that ambient air pollution kills more people than tobacco smoking and violence. In 2017, cardiovascular disease caused 18million deaths followed by cancer with 10million. The Sars epidemic cost $30billion in four months. The next pandemic, which is probably hibernating, could kill millions and has the potential to reduce global GDP by 10%. Prudence dictates that rather than wait until the next pandemic hits, we should start planning now. Covid-19 was a deadly wake-up call.
