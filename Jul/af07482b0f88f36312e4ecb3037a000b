WENTWORTH church leaders have called for community solidarity in combating key issues affecting the area such as criminal activity, hunger and the community’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. Speaking at a media briefing with pastors from churches in the area, Pastor Andre Bailey said drugs, gang violence and shootings still plagued the area despite the lockdown. He felt that local media could play an integral role. “This will allow us to be heard especially in this time we are in, when social gatherings, marches and public meetings are not allowed due to the coronavirus pandemic,” said Bailey. Churches have worked to assist police forums with fighting crime, used as a platform to spread awareness. According to Pastor Donny Anderson, of the Apostolic Faith Mission Church, there has been a close relationship among churches, Community Policing Forums and police. “We’ve now used our position in the pulpit to foster better relationships with law enforcement as well as the community to ensure regulations are adhered to and combat crime in the area. We are grateful for SAPS’ efforts to help the community,” said Anderson who is also the CPF chairperson. Ward councillor Aubrey Snyman commended the churches’ efforts to help residents and appealed to the community to be more responsible in the fight against the pandemic. “People have been taking things for granted and they are not adhering to the regulations which is disappointing. Churches can only do so much. So I ask that people adhere to rules and remember that it is through unity that we can overcome this adversity.” Daily News
