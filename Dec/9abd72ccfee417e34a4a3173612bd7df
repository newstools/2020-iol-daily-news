Durban – Persistence by the Hawks has led to the arrest of five suspects believed to be behind a drug laboratory. Hawks spokesperson Captain Simphiwe Mhlongo said the suspects, one being the chairperson of the Chatsworth Minibus Taxi Association, Collin Naidoo, his sons and other suspects appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court yesterday and were remanded until their bail hearing on Thursday. Mhlongo said officers “left no stone unturned” in their investigations and on Sunday swooped on the five men in Chatsworth and eManzimtoti. The men, aged between 27 and 54, were arrested for manufacturing as well as dealing in drugs. “Hawks members conducted a number of undercover operations before cracking the alleged syndicate. “In March, one of the suspects was arrested for manufacturing and dealing in drugs at Hillcrest. The drug laboratory was dismantled and police seized paraphernalia as well as heroin with a street value of approximately R1.6 million,” said Mhlongo. The arrests were carried out by Hawks from Durban Serious Organised Crime Investigation, assisted by the Special Task Force and South African Revenue Service Customs. In the March arrest of the 40-year-old suspect for possession and dealing in drugs, the Hawks had received a tip-off about a man delivering drugs in Hillcrest. Officers stopped and searched the vehicle and found heroin capsules. A search of the premises led to more heroin capsules, 600 000 empty capsule casings and paraphernalia being seized. Chatsworth Minibus Taxi Association spokesperson Bashir Ismail said all they knew was that the chairperson was away. IOL
