Durban - Children’s rights advocacy group Childline KZN has welcomed the decision by Durban High Court Judge Jacqueline Henriques, who found the Miguel Louw murder accused guilty of kidnapping, theft and murder. Childline KZN acting director Adeshini Naicker said although it has taken two years, they welcomed and applauded the judgment. “It sends out a strong message to would-be perpetrators and is definitely a deterrent.  This is a victory especially in the midst of 16 Days of Activism.” Mohammed Vahed Ebrahim, 44, was found guilty of Miguel’s 2018 murder. Miguel was last seen with him at a KFC near his home in July that year. His decomposed body was found in a shallow grave near Ebrahim's Phoenix home in Longbury Drive two months later. During the trial the State alleged that Ebrahim, who lives in Longbury Phoenix, occasionally lived at Miguel's home in Sydenham and performed odd jobs around their home. During her judgment, Henriques said that Ebrahim and Miguel's mother, Raylen, had an argument prior to the child being kidnapped and that while Raylen had seen him as a friend he wanted more. She said she had come to her conclusion based on evaluation and consideration of evidence in its entirety. “I have analysed the evidence carefully, considered the probabilities and the improbabilities, contradictions, inconsistencies, deliberate falsehoods and most importantly the demeanour of all the witnesses,” she said. During the judgment, Ebrahim shook his head. He seemed visibly shaken, widening his eyes after his guilty conviction was delivered. Shortly after court proceedings, Ebrahim stood at the bottom of the stairs in court waiting for the police to lead him back to the cells with a bewildered look on his face. Miguel's family was instructed by the investigating officer not to speak to the media just yet. Miguel's grandmother, Arlene Amardien, only just said, "God is good", as pictures of them were taken outside the courtroom. Daily News
