Durban - The bail application for the 15-year-old charged with the murder and rape of 3-year-old Sanelisiwe Mhlongo did not go ahead in the Ntuzuma Magistrate's Court yesterday as it was decided the teen would undergo psychiatric evaluation. National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara said the matter was postponed to Friday. This was the teen’s second appearance in court following his arrest. The accused is a relative of the KwaMashu toddler. According to police, Sanelisiwe was left in the care of a relative while her mother went to work. When her mother returned home, she was told the girl had gone missing. Her body was later found in bushes near her home. She had sustained stab wounds to her body as well as a head injury. When police arrested the teenager for the murder, a weapon thought to have been used to commit the crime was recovered. Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza called on the criminal justice system to ensure that perpetrators of gender-based violence were punished with tough sentences. “We call on the police to work around the clock to ensure that the perpetrators of women's and children's murders are found and handed to the courts so that they can be given sentences that fit their deplorable crimes.” Daily News
