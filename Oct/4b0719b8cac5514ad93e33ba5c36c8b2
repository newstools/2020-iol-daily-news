Durban - OPPOSITION parties in the KwaZulu-Natal legislature were left underwhelmed by a presentation of the Social Development Department in the province on its policies to tackle fraud and corruption within its ranks. Sibongile Mlambo, director of risk management and internal auditing, made a presentation to the Social Development portfolio committee in a virtual meeting on Tuesday. She said the department encouraged employees and stakeholders to prevent and deter fraud and corruption. “The department has zero tolerance towards fraud and corruption in all its manifestations,” she said. The Fraud and Prevention Strategy she presented was based on a plan the department formulated in 2014. The presentation touched on how the department tackled corruption and fraud, and how whistle-blowers were treated when they exposed malfeasance. The policy aimed to encourage a culture of disclosure in a way that did not have negative effects. Committee member Les Govender said the presentation did not help them understand what the department was doing to stop corruption within the department. He said they were expecting more than just a presentation on rules and regulations. Another committee member, Shameen Thakur-Rajbansi, said the presentation was “thin”. She wanted more detail on the whistle-blower policy as people who wanted to share information on wrongdoing turned to the press instead of using internal means to air problems. Daily News
