Durban - Exactly a week after the discovery of the bodies of two murdered women in KwaMashu, two more women were killed at KwaDabeka, and another in Stanger. Last Tuesday, the bodies of two women, believed to be in their twenties, were discovered with gunshot wounds to the head. They were found in bushes on Sigede Road, in KwaMashu. Yesterday morning, people expressed shock as news of the murder of 36-year-old Nomcebo Magudulela, on Monday night, was shared on Facebook. “It’s so painful fellow ladies, as she was allegedly killed by someone whom she thought loved her, but that same person assaulted and even stabbed her,” wrote a friend of Magudulela’s on Facebook. According to police, Magudulela was taken to hospital, where she died from her injuries. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said it was alleged she was at home at Lindelani A section, in Stanger, when a man broke into the house and stabbed her several times. “The victim ran to a neighbour for help and she was rushed to hospital where she died. KwaDukuza Police Station is investigating a case of murder,” said Mbele. The killer was apparently known to Magudulela and is being sought. Also yesterday, the bodies of a 13-year-old and 30-year-old were found dumped at the uMngeni River in KwaDabeka. Mbele said they appeared to have been assaulted, burnt and strangled to death. “A docket with two counts of murder was opened at KwaDabeka Police Station for investigation,” said Mbele. Facebook users posted in a community group about the discovery. “If you know of a girl, aged around 12, and their mother, both missing, there are bodies that have been dumped near KwaDabeka F, near uMngeni River. The child is wearing a white vest. The mother was stuffed into a large bag, naked,” wrote MaOcean MakaBo Omuhle. Daily News
