Durban - A HILLCREST family has praised all those involved in the search for Leighton Frank Agg, pictured, whose body was found in Pietermaritzburg on Wednesday. Agg, 42, was reported missing on September 30. His missing person’s report states that he got into his Ford Bantam bakkie the day he disappeared, heading to Hillcrest for an appointment. He did not show up and his bakkie was found on Friday. Agg’s body was found on Otto’s Bluff Road in Pietermaritzburg. His sister, Tarryn Kihn, who had made an appeal on social media for people to help in the search, said the bakkie was found abandoned in Pietermaritzburg, with the licence plates and disc removed. “We think he had been hijacked. Police managed to find my parents and notified them. My brother lives in Hillcrest. My parents last spoke to him on Wednesday evening. They tried to call him, but his phone was switched off. “His bank had confirmed that money was taken out of his account on Friday, but they would not disclose details of how much or where. We are obviously terrified about what has happened to him,” Kihn said while the search was on. She said the family was devastated at the discovery of his body. “Our family has started the long journey of grieving and healing. Justice will be served, but South Africa especially does not need more hate and negativity. My brother is now with God and his soul is at peace,” she said. Kihn said since Agg’s disappearance, volunteers, crime watch groups and the police had conducted searches of Hillcrest and surrounding areas. “To all the hundreds of people who took part in searches, those who were helping to obtain and analyse camera footage and cellphone records, without all of you, he would never have been found. We will be forever grateful and you will always be remembered.” Private investigator Brad Nathanson said an arrest had been made by the police, with further arrests imminent. Daily News
