SD Video Enterprises director Satish Dhupelia said he had worked on a number of productions, both local and international, with Khan. He said it was rare to find someone like Khan, who shared the same passion for technology. He said Khan had come from an analogue background, but had embraced digital technology. “He did the sound and I did the video and screens. We travelled this country together, working and having fun. I treasure those great memories. We enjoyed a great friendship. Last year I had occasion to visit him a number of times. We spent many hours reminiscing. He had expanded into audiovisual and was very knowledgeable. I loved our technology talks. Many local artists will remember doing recordings in his studios and the care he took doing them,” Dhupelia said. On Facebook, Nalini Maharaj described Khan as a true gentleman and a genius in his field. “I remember the laughter we shared with him. His memories will be always cherished by all that met him,” Maharaj said. Daily News
