Durban - AS the world commemorated World Teachers’ Day yesterday, local teachers’ unions said despite the challenges faced by the coronavirus, there was still much to be celebrated as teachers formed a vital part of South Africa’s economy. SA Democratic Teachers’ Union provincial secretary Nomarashiya Caluza said the status of the teacher in society has diminished, partly due to the rise of for-profit private schools. With Covid-19 killing more than a million people around the world, safety has become a key aspect of teaching. “This year, teachers are seen as lazy when they raise safety issues. But it is the safety of the teacher and the child that is at issue here,” she said. Caluza said another issue that needed to be tackled was violence at schools, where both teachers and pupils were affected. “The mental health of teachers is important. If you ignore this, then they will become demotivated and it will affect the community in the long run,” said Caluza. Allen Thompson, president of the National Teachers’ Union, said there was every cause to celebrate teachers this year. “Even though Covid-19 presented challenges, teachers were able to find innovative ways to carry on teaching children like using WhatsApp and through other means, which at times came at great personal cost,” said Thompson. Thompson said teachers played a central role in the establishment of a viable economy in South Africa, as they played a role in educating people. Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said teachers were the foundation of a successful nation. He said that this year had been a difficult one but, through the dedication of teachers, they had been able to save the academic year. “We want to pay tribute to those teachers who succumbed to Covid-19 and we believe that their deaths will not be in vain,” said Mshengu. He said the department would endeavour to improve teachers’ working conditions. Daily News
