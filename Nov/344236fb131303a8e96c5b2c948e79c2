According to Shoprite,  the group also invested just over R490 million in training and skills development programmes rolled out to both employees and non-employees. Furthermore its employees enjoy job security as none of its 141 245 employees were retrenched even as the Covid-19 pandemic continues unabated. Committed to reducing its environmental impact while promoting operational efficiency, the retailer has aligned its goals focused on climate change, water security, sustainable packaging, waste management and responsible sourcing, with that of the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goals. The retailer also formulated position statements on climate change and water security in the last year. “Our approach to the problem of climate change is twofold: In the first instance we try to mitigate its effects by for instance increasing our reliance on renewable energy sources and rolling out energy efficient lighting in our stores. The other way is through adaptation, where we seek to strengthen the resilience and adaptive capacity of our operations and that of the communities in which we operate by ensuring food security through the extensive support of community food gardens, surplus food donations and disaster relief through our fleet of mobile soup kitchens,” said Sanjeev Raghubir, the Group’s Sustainability Manager. “We are extremely proud of the sustainability milestones reached in the last financial year and look forward to doing more to support the communities we serve, to safeguard our environment and to continue to provide job opportunities,” he added.
