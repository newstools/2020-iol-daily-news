Sifiso Ngidi, deputy secretary- general of the Public and Allied Workers’ Union of SA, said moving operations to Phoenix was not done in a proper way because services were continuing yet workers were suspended. “We believe suspending workers was done so the department can do what they want without anyone disturbing them by asking questions. “These are workers that were fired by the department back in November. Last month, the department changed its mind and said these workers could return to work, but they would be suspended and charged, some with matters dating back to 2006,” Ngidi said. Nomakiki Majola, chairperson of the health portfolio committee in the KZN Legislature, said it was an embarrassment that workers were marching over moving to Phoenix even though they knew the working conditions at Gale Street were not ideal. “Workers are allowed in discussions about the removal of the mortuary to Phoenix. I don’t know why they say they are not involved in discussions because their union representatives are there. I think their problem is that they are suspended,” she said. The Health Department said: “The Magwaza Maphalala (Gale) Street mortuary performed an essential service and for a long time it has been riddled with problems. The building is old, it cannot be repaired, there’s not enough space and it is located where a mortuary shouldn’t be. The machinery always breaks.” Daily News
