Paul Jacobs, a resident at an old-age home, fits the mould of the stereotypical senior citizen, at least from the outside. However, at the tender age of 101 years young, Jacobs is not your typical retiree. His days begin in the early hours, waking at 5am, and like clockwork, starting his daily routine. This begins with a short trip on his mobility scooter down to the beachfront, taking in the fresh air and enjoying the embrace of the sea breeze, which has been his companion on a daily basis for the last 16 years. Using the equipment at the municipal beachfront gym, Jacobs warms up, leading to the exercises to which he attributes living a long and healthy life. After a 10-minute warm-up, he begins a routine of yoga exercises which he’s been doing for the past 60 years. His go-to yoga stretch is the shoulder stand, but previously he could boast being able to perform a headstand, showing off his age-defying flexibility and young-at-heart spirit.  Jacobs will turn 102 on August 7 and is the oldest person at his old-age home. He has two children, four grandchildren and six great-grand- children. Jacobs spends 30 to 40 minutes doing yoga and insists that the secret to longevity lies in remaining as active as possible, “even when age says otherwise”. “The main thing is that you want your mind to remain active because when you let your mind deteriorate, that’s when you pass away.” Jacobs also attributes his longevity to a diet that does not include fats.
