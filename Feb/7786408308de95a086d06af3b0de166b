Ntuthuko Mabaso, 26, appeared in the Durban Magistrate’s Court on Tuesday, where he told the court through his attorney, C Maimane, that he was abandoning his bail application. He faces charges of murder and unlawful possession of a firearm and ammunition. Prosecutor Kuveshni Pillay told the court that the State intended adding a robbery with aggravating circumstances (house robbery) charge, as well as car-jacking and an additional charge of murder - for a case related to a shooting on the South Coast. Further details are expected during his court appearance next week. Magistrate Vanitha Armu said Mabaso must be kept at Durban North police station, at the request of police detectives. Mabaso appeared in the dock with a bandage around his left arm, after he was allegedly bitten by a police dog while fleeing from police. National police spokesperson Brigadier Vish Naidoo said Cele was shot, allegedly by Mabaso. Cele and his partner had stopped a vehicle in the Berea area when he came under fire. The policeman died in hospital. “The accused was arrested in Pietermaritzburg. He was attempting to board a bus to Johannesburg. The accused spotted the police approaching and attempted to flee but was arrested by the police K9 unit. He was found in possession of a SAPS service pistol, which had been taken from a police official in uMlazi, in December 2019,” Naidoo said. Daily News
