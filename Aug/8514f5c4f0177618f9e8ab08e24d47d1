Durban - Phoenix Animal Care & Treatment (Pact) will be hosting their kennel challenge this Saturday to raise funds. It will be slightly different because of Covid-19. Participants will be able to pitch a tent in their room, garage, garden or anywhere they can at home and live in it for 12 hours, from 8am to 8pm to raise a minimum of R2 500 before the 12 hours are up. People were previously locked up in a real kennel. For the kennel challenge, people can donate on BackaBuddy, or make donations in the form of pet food, blankets and anything Pact would need. Pact founder Neeri Naidoo said all non-profit organisations were restricted in hosting events to raise funds, therefore Pact felt they needed to be more proactive because their animal cases had increased. “We went from feeding 83 animals to feeding 196 because people have lost their jobs, etc, so we have taken on all those animals,” said Naidoo. She said as she ran Pact, she felt more responsible for the animals, and also felt hopeless. She hosted events and adoption days, and even though they had been working non-stop, she still felt she was not doing enough. “I decided that I would make my amount higher than everyone else (R20 000 for kennel challenge) just because of the responsibility I feel. I also decided to take it one step further, using this opportunity to create awareness around something I struggle with in the different communities, which is animals being chained up. So my specific challenge will be to be kennelled and also to be chained.” Naidoo said lawyer Tash Giyapersad decided to share the challenge with her and raised her amount to R50 000. Together they had a combined total of R70 000 and would be kennelled and chained at Chris Saunders Park, outside Gateway. “I also hope that people will come by and just drop off any donations,” Naidoo said. Pact has given itself until June next year to home all its animals and pay off its huge debt in vet bills. Daily News
