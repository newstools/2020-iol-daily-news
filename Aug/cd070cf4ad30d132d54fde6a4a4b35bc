Durban - Six people including an infant were killed in two separate crashes in KwaZulu-Natal on Sunday. In the first incident, a family of three, a 52-year-old woman, 63-year-old man and a seven-month-old infant were killed on the N2 near Queen Nandi Drive. Leon Fourie of Life Response 24/7 said their paramedics responded to the scene of the southbound carriageway and found that a Toyota Hilux had veered off the road and crashed into a steel support structure of an overhead sign board. “Sadly there was nothing that could be done to help the infant and the female and male, they were declared deceased on arrival of paramedics,” said Fourie. “Five other occupants of the vehicle were found to have suffered injuries, with three of them in a critical condition. Advanced Life Support intervention was needed to stabilise them, before they were transported by ambulances, to various nearby receiving medical facilities for further definitive care.” Fourie said it was unclear as to what caused the crash but it would form part of the SAPS investigation. Further north of Durban, IPSS Medical Rescue responded to a single vehicle accident on the R74 near the Blythedale offramp. IPSS Medical Rescue spokesperson Paul Herbst said it was alleged that a vehicle was traveling towards the N2 when the driver allegedly lost control, rolling the vehicle multiple times. “Three occupants were ejected from the vehicle and sustained fatal injuries. A fourth occupant sustained serious injuries and was still trapped in the wreckage; whilst under the care of IPSS advanced life support paramedics, the patient was extracted and transported to hospital for further care,” said Herbst. Police had not commented by the time of publication. Daily News
