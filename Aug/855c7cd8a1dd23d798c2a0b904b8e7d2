Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has postponed its executive committee meeting on Thursday leading to the opposition parties accusing the political leadership of the city of sabotaging service delivery. The DAs Nicole Graham said this was “an incredibly important” meeting for the residents of eThekwini. “The meeting in June collapsed due to technical difficulties and we didn’t have a meeting in July because there was a Covid-19 issue among the secretariat department so there are lots of issues that have been long outstanding, issues that needed to be ratified. ’’There was an adjustment budget on the agenda, the bus entity issue and some significant reports from the audit committee that had to be attended to. All of those things significantly impact on how the city works,” said Graham. She said it was clear that there was some politics behind the postponement of the meeting as all their members and those of the smaller parties were logged in on time. The Daily News reported late last month that the Covid-19 pandemic had brought the eThekwini council to a halt as meetings had been cancelled because of a number of infections in the secretariat. Most of the secretariat’s senior staff were reportedly either in self-isolation or under quarantine after testing positive for Covid-19. IFPs Mdu Nkosi said at around 12pm he questioned what the Rules of Order stipulated with regards to the commencement of the council meeting. “This is an embarrassment for eThekwini and it’s not for the benefit of the public, but to its detriment. The ruling party is in disarray and this is not acceptable as this impacts badly on service delivery,” Nkosi said. Spokesperson for eThekwini Mayor Mluleki Mntungwa said he would find out the reasons why the meeting had been postponed. He had not returned with the information by the time of publishing. Daily News
