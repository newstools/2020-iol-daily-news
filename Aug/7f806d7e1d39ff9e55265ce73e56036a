Durban - A serial killer is believed to be pouncing on unsuspecting women in the Turton area, uMthwalume on the South Coast of the province. On Tuesday, Zama Chiliza’s decomposing body was found in an area where the bodies of other three women were found in the past two months. Chiliza, 38, is believed to have been returning from the local clinic when she met her death. Tuesday’s gruesome discovery was made by a woman wood collector who informed the local CPF. The killings have prompted the IFP in the area to call for urgent police intervention from national level. Party chairperson in the Ugu district Sfundo Ngwane said the latest incident has reaffirmed local community's suspicion of a serial killer roaming their village. “Chiliza’s body was retrieved from the bushes in the Mathisini area. The victim is believed to have been murdered on her way back from the local clinic, as she had a bag in her possession with clinic cards. It is unfortunate that as a community we have exhausted all means of trying to work with Hibberdene Police station but instead they arrested the community members who were protesting against the killing of women. The community no longer has faith in the local police, as no arrests have been made thus far," said Ngwane. He said following the last three bodies, local men had volunteered to patrol the area at night provided that they received police blessing. “The IFP condemns the killing of and abuse of our women in the strongest terms. We cannot allow our women to live in fear. We bow our heads in shame that our women are killed in a month where they are supposed to celebrate their womanhood,” said Ngwane. The police forensic team and sniffer dogs are currently combing the scene for any possible leads that could assist in the investigation. Daily News
