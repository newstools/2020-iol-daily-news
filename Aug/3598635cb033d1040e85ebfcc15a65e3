Durban - Three spotted Eagle Owl chicks have been re-homed in a nest box placed just above their previous home in a tree in Umkomaas. A concerned Umkomaas resident found the chicks on the ground, on Sunday, and immediately contacted Scottburgh’s Crocworld Conservation Centre for assistance. Ryne Ferguson, the team’s Bird Curator, headed to the location to assess the situation. While the chick’s parents watched cautiously from above, Ferguson inspected the hollow in the tree. He found it overrun by ants and unsafe for the chicks. The trio of owlets were taken back to Crocworld Conservation Centre where they were fed and monitored for two days, before being re-homed in a nest box placed just above the hollow. The concerned resident monitored the owlets all afternoon and evening. He alerted Ferguson on Wednesday that the parents had joined the chicks in the nest box and all were doing well. Crocworld and the community will continue to monitor the owl family over the next few days. According to Wikipedia, the spotted eagle-owl (Bubo africanus), also called African spotted eagle-owl, and African eagle-owl, is a medium-sized species of owl, one of the smallest of the eagle owls. Its length is 45 centimetres  and its weight is from 454 to 907 grams. It has a 100 to 140 centimetres wingspan. The facial disk is off white to pale ochre and the eyes are yellow. It has prominent ear tufts, and the upper body is dusky brown, the lower parts off-white with brown bars. Its prey mainly consists of rodents, small mammals, birds, insects and reptiles. It often swallows its prey whole, with much head-jerking, pausing and resting in between, while a portion of the prey remains inside the mouth, until the prey can finally be swallowed down completely.
