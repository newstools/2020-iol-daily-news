Durban - ABOUT 2.8 million pupils at over 6 000 schools are expected to return to school on Monday said Premier Sihle Zikalala at his weekly Covid-19 briefing. “The Department of Education in the province has thoroughly prepared for the full opening of the system. All Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and other essentials have been procured and delivery made to schools,” he said. Monday and Tuesday Grades R, 1, 6, 10 and 11 would return to school, while Grades 2, 5, 8 and 9 return on Wednesday and Thursday. “After the week, schools will then be able to create their own timetables according to their needs.” Grades 7 and 12 returned to school in June. Zikalala also tackled a common complaint about the provision of water to ensure there was proper sanitisation at schools. “As part of ensuring a sustainable solution, the department has started a programme of drilling boreholes at schools. This work is undertaken through Public Works and IDT. Currently, 600 schools have been identified for the immediate drilling of boreholes, while studies to ascertain the availability of underground water in other schools are proceeding.” Education MEC Kwazi Mshengu said more than 5000 teachers who had comorbidities had asked for special concessions which meant that some teachers would work for certain hours of the day and then go home. “Of the 5979 teachers, 4475 fell within the categories of collective agreements between the department and employees, while the rest have illnesses which do not fall within this category. “Their cases will be considered by the health risk inspector who will advise the department on whether to accept or decline these requests,” the MEC explained.
