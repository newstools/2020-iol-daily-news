Durban - A TEENAGE boy was arrested at the alleged storage premises of the Bloods gang, for drug possession and drug dealing, during a tactical operation by the Metro Police Drug Team and Counter Narcotics. Metro Police commissioner Steve Middleton said the operation was conducted at the weekend in Viewhaven Drive, in Woodview, at the alleged heroin storage premises of the Bloods gang. “The identified storage target was arrested for dealing and possession of heroin,” said Middleton. “Exhibits seized were 4 704 heroin capsules to the value of R94 080.” Last year, police had raided the home of alleged Bloods gang leader Kevin Periasamy, where two pistols, a shotgun, 64 live rounds of ammunition, 1836 heroin caps, 138 heroin straws, 80 large crack cocaine pieces, 30 Mandrax tablets, and three bags of cocaine, ecstasy and dagga were recovered. Police spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele confirmed the 17-year-old’s arrest on Saturday morning, adding he was released into his parents’ custody. Mbele said he was expected to appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court today. Phoenix Community Policing Forum (CPF) chairperson Umesh Singh said, from the complaints they received, the drug trade was rife in the Phoenix area and police were doing their best as the complaints were coming through. They were making arrests but he did not think it was strong enough to deter drug dealers. “From what we believe, more and more shops are opening - whether under the banner of runners or under the banner of branches,” said Singh.
