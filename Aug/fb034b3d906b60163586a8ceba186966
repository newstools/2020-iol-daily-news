Durban - PEDESTRIANS crossing Higginson Highway from railway platforms pose a risk to themselves and motorists, says the Chatsworth Safety Alert group. Also of concern were loose stones from the railway tracks spilling on to the right lane of the highway adjacent to the Chatsglen/Croftdene railway station and opposite Link Road in Shallcross, said spokesperson Suren Ganapathie. He said he had been engaging for nearly a year through emails with the Passenger Rail Agency of SA (Prasa) to find a solution to the problem. Prasa needed to prevent passengers from walking on or across the tracks and scattering the stones on the highway. He said passengers exited the station through damaged portions of the fence rather than using footbridges. “I suggested that a wall would be a good deterrent, and additional security guards patrolling the route. We are waiting for a disaster or tragedy to occur. It took a while before officials actually visited the site,” he said. “The stones are placed in a manner that forms a slope. To prevent the stones from falling over from the track, install a wall, to be higher than the slope along the railway line. This will surely prevent the stones from being kicked and dispersed on to the right lane of this busy highway.” Damaged fences are common near most railway stations in Chatsworth, he added. Ganapathie said most had been damaged through vehicle collisions. He said some portions were deliberately damaged to create access points for passengers exiting the station. Prasa KwaZulu-Natal spokesperson Zama Nomnganga said due to multiple motor vehicle collisions, the fencing was damaged in places. “The matter is with our infrastructure committee; to have a solid wall erected in that corridor. There are footbridges but investigations revealed commuters or pedestrians are not using them. This will be addressed.” Daily News
