Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has, after nearly five month of lockdown, opened the beaches, nature reserves and public park to visitors, in line with the relaxation of the regualtions to alert level 2, announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday. However, the city in a statement on Tuesday was quick to point out that swimming at the beach is still prohibited until further notice. “These regulations allow that residents utilise these recreational amenities for activities such jogging on the sand, walking, running, yoga and other healthy lifestyle exercises whilst, the municipality is taking the necessary steps to ensure regulations for swimming are in place,” city pokesperson, Msawakhe Mayisela said. “The public is further advised that while beaches are now open for the public to use, the full protocols are still being prepared and confirmation is being sought for bathing and surfing from the Provincial Authorities on certain omissions not appearing in the gazetted policy as per the National gazetted regulations. In the interim, the Parks, Leisure and Cemeteries Department is ensuring that the lifeguards and beach maintenance staff are trained and equipped with the regulated necessary personal protective equipment to undertake safe rescues. Protocols are still being finalised for the re-opening of the beaches to the public,” he said. Mayisela  said  that it should be noted too that, the shark nets are still not in place and will not be able to be launched for the next few days due to the severe weather conditions which are about to hit the coast. “While the Department is excited that the public will once again be able to enjoy City’s lovely beach facilities, eThekwini will be monitoring the situation closely to ensure social distancing and restrictions with reference to the numbers on the beach are adhered to,” Mayisela added. “The public is hereby requested to please note that, the country is still on lockdown and as a result, group activities and events that attract a large number of spectators are not permitted”.
