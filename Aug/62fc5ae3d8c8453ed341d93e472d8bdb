Durban - LIFE under the new normal has brought about many changes and for the churches in Cato Manor, this has resulted in various denominations coming together to effect change in the community beyond their walls. With limited interaction between churches and the community, church leaders were concerned that under level 2 of the lockdown, people would let down their guard. This resulted in their awareness campaign which included distributing masks to commuters at various taxi ranks in the area. In partnership with a University of KwaZulu-Natal student and member of the Durban YMCA, 20 church leaders along with volunteers started an initiative travelling to Cato Crest, Bonela, Wiggins, Chesterville and Ridgeview taxi ranks to provide awareness and distributed about 10 000 masks thus far, and provided a few words from the Bible and a prayer if the situation warranted it. UKZN student YMCA secretary Andile Mafa said: “Now being at level 2 of the lockdown, we realised that there would be more movement of people as many would be returning to work or going back to school. “Many areas in Cato Manor are quite congested, creating the ideal conditions for new infections, so we hand out masks and bring a reminder to people about regulations.” Mafa said the masks were also distributed to the public and those travelling in private vehicles. Churches in Cato Manor also have a food programme delivering parcels to parishioners and, according to Mafa, this enabled churches to have a better understanding about issues affecting their communities. “This is more than just about providing food for people - it enables us to get closer to the community, as hunger isn’t the only problem that the people have to overcome. “Depression as a result of the fallout from the lockdown is a big issue. So we are able to sit down with our communities over a meal and lend an ear. That way, we can discuss their issues and provide help where we can, and offer them hope through prayer.” Daily News
