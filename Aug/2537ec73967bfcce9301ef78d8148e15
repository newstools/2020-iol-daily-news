Durban - OVERPORT residents have been left frustrated over the illegal dumping of refuse in public spaces. According to ward councillor Haniff Hassan, illegal dumping has been escalating, with Felix Dlamini (Brickfield) Road identified as the epicentre. Hassan said other parts of the area were also emerging as hot spots. “The illegal dumping in the Overport area, especially on Felix Dlamini Road, is really getting out of control. We’ve been working together with Durban Solid Waste education, DSW and the metro police to address it. “When you look at the corner of Clayton and Felix Dlamini roads you can see it is a hot spot. So we are trying our best to educate residents about illegal dumping and appeal to them to work with us to address this issue.” Activist Solidarity Forum and Ratepayers’ Association chairperson Imtiaz Syed cited a lack of social responsibility by residents and a rise in vagrancy as the main causes for the problem. “At the moment we have problems with the apathy we see from tenants living in blocks of flats, and unethical business practices where refuse is not disposed of properly and increasing vagrancy in the area. “We as the community can’t expect the municipality, DSW or the metro police to enforce by-laws when we are not coming to the table despite knowing what to do,” said Syed. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the matter would be investigated. “Residents have no excuse for dumping illegally. The eThekwini Municipality has a number of landfill sites that can be used by residents. We believe in having thriving communities, and a clean environment is so important in ensuring that we have healthy communities. “We urge residents to continue reporting illegal dumping to 0313118804 and to take care of the environment and not litter,” he said.
