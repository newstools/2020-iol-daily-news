Durban - WITH many South Africans taking up online shopping due to the lockdown, experts have warned that this was the time cyber-criminals preyed on novices in online commerce. “Online banking, banking apps and mobile banking are the most common platforms that enable digital financial fraud,” said RCS group chief risk officer Balraj Dev. He said these crimes were becoming more sophisticated and urged people to take precautions. “In addition to only using registered banking apps, consumers should educate themselves on how phishing and vishing scams are typically presented so as not to be caught out. “Such attempts often occur through emails and phone calls by fraudsters who claim to be long-lost family members; a new love interest; a bank official; a fictional charity; or a false debt collector stating that a deceased family member has outstanding debt.” Dev said research suggested that financial fraud may have a sudden surge as much as 80% this year because more people have turned to online interactions because of Covid-19. Technology expert Arthur Goldstuck has been saying for years that more people were going online as the price of data and smartphones went down. Criminals were aware of this trend and targeted people who were relatively new to the online space. He said the groups most vulnerable were the elderly and young people who were new to the technology. “Elderly people are a goldmine for cyber criminals,” he said. Daily News
