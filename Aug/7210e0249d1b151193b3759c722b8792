Durban - The eThekwini Municipality has dismissed a widely circulated message on social media that warns of seven hour water cuts every night starting on Thursday. The fake message details wide-spread water cuts to affect almost every area in eThekwini as a result of “drought” conditions. The fake message that has lit up WhatsApp groups across Durban said that the city will be limiting water supply in all Municipal areas. “Residents are warned that these are false news which are disseminated with intentions to cause unnecessary panic amongst residents and tarnish the image of the Municipality. The Municipality wishes to advise residents that there is only one planned shut down for Sea Cow Lake/Springfield Park – North of Durban, which has already been communicated to the public,” the city said in a statement. This shut down will commence on Wednesday, 12 August 2020 at 18h00pm, until the early hours of Thursday, 13 August 2020 at 06h00am. The process will only affect Sea Cow Lake/Springfield Park and surrounding areas, the statement added. “Members of the public are urged not to fall for these fake news. The Municipality has communication platforms to inform the public about it programmes and projects. For more information and enquiries on water related matters, members of the public can contact eThekwini Water and Sanitation Call Centre on 080 13 13 013 or WhatsApp number: 073 1483 477”. According to the latest dam data by Umgeni Water - the main bulk water supplier to eThekwini Municipality, - more than 80% of dams under its management is more than 50% full. Daily News
