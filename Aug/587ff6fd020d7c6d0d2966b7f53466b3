Durban - THE five criminals who were killed in a shootout with police on Tuesday afternoon had already committed two crimes that morning, said police. Spokesperson Colonel Thembeka Mbele said officers from the Durban K9 Unit were following up on information about a stolen vehicle that had been used in a number of criminal acts in Durban. Mbele said the vehicle had been used to commit car-jackings and robberies in areas such as Pinetown, Umbilo and Berea before it was spotted on the M7 highway towards Bellair. A chase then ensued between the men and the police which took them towards Malvern. The criminals’ vehicle crashed into a concrete light pole and brick wall on Woodlands Avenue in Bellair while shots were fired at police. “Five suspects, believed to be in their thirties, were declared dead at the scene. Three unlicensed firearms with six rounds of ammunition were seized from the dead suspects. They were positively linked to a business robbery case that was committed on Tuesday in Umbilo, where a vehicle and other belongings were taken from the business premises.” Mbele said the men were also linked to another case of car-jacking reported in Pinetown where a motorist was robbed of his vehicle Tuesday. Umbilo Community Police Forum chairperson Heather Roos said a robbery had taken place at Berea Laundry Services on Tuesday morning. When the Daily News asked Roos if a vehicle and other belongings had been taken during the robbery, she said she was awaiting an update from the Umbilo SAPS. Daily News
