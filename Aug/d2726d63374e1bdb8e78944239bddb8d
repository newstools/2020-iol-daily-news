THE construction of the 70m tie-in to the sea outfall effluent pipe at the Cuttings Beach in Merewent is nearing completion. eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela said the project started in response to ageing infrastructure which was affecting the Southern Waste Water Treatment Works. According to Mayisela, it is in its final phase, the tie-in of the new section of the outfall pipeline. The newly constructed effluent pipeline will replace the old section of the pipeline. Both pipes are underground with paving and a promenade for public use above it. Access to Cuttings Beach is closed. Construction is expected to be completed by Monday. Mayisela said the beach would be opened only when it was deemed safe. Dr Desmond D’Sa of the South Durban Community Environmental Alliance said there needed to be investments to develop equipment that leads to chemical reduction in the pipeline. “What is needed is reduction at the source. We need chemical companies that produce all this waste to spend their millions of rand of profit to develop systems that deal with sewerage in a different way rather than the ocean becoming a dumping ground. “We need more enforcement officers employed to ensure illegal dumping of chemicals and sewerage into the rivers is eradicated,” he said. The eThekwini Municipality website states that there has always been a concern in South Africa in general, and Durban in particular, of the increased demands on South Africa's limited water resources. Durban treats in the region of 450 million litres of wastewater daily, and in this context, the Council's eThekwini Water Services (EWS) commenced an investigation into the recycling of treated waste water.
