Durban- A grim picture of the South African transport industry was shown by a report that was released by Statistics South Africa this week. The report found that in the month of June passenger journeys decreased by 63,1percent when compared to the same month in 2019. “Seasonally adjusted passenger journeys decreased by 65,6% in the second quarter of 2020 compared with the first quarter of 2020. Road passenger journeys decreased by 53,5% (contributing -39,4 percentage points) and rail passenger journeys decreased by 99,2% (contributing -26,2 percentage points),” the report said. The report was released as South Africa prepares to enter level two lockdown on Tuesday which meant that the easing of restrictions allowed people to move between provinces which was announced by president Cyril Ramaphosa on Saturday night. This was not the only set of numbers that were released by the organisation on Monday.  StatsSA also released a report on tourist accommodation. Income from tourist accommodation decreased by 96.9 percent in the second quarter of 2020 when it was compared to the same period in 2019. This was part of a negative year-on-year growth experienced by the tourism industry that was caused by the lockdown. Earlier on Monday, IOL reported that the move to level two lockdown had been welcomed by tourism industry that has been left battered by the lockdown. Some of the industry’s big players like the Sun International Group said they would still maintain their current health protocols which met international benchmarks. Daily News
