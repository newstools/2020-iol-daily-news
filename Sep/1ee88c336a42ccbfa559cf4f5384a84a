Durban - POLICE have yet to arrest the main suspect in a case where a woman was allegedly defrauded by a man who claimed he was mayor Mxolisi Kaunda. This emerged yesterday in the Durban Magistrate’s Court, where 28-year-old Cebolenkosi Vincent Mzobe made his first appearance on the charges of fraud and theft. Prosecutor Surekha Marimuthu told the court the State intended opposing bail, and had asked for an adjournment until next Monday for bail consideration. “The main suspect is still outstanding in this matter,” said Marimuthu. After the interpreter had explained Mzobe’s rights she told him of the charges he faced, to which he replied: “My charges are not like that.” According to the charge sheet, it was alleged that earlier this month, in Durban, Mzobe defrauded Nothile Magwaza. “Whereas, in truth and in fact, when the accused gave out and pretended as aforesaid, he knew that the person communicating with Nothile Magwaza was not the mayor of Durban,” it said. Regarding Mzobe’s theft charge, it is alleged that on September 26 the accused intentionally stole R4000 in Magwaza’s possession. According to police, Mzobe was arrested in a sting operation on Saturday, where he was picking up a R200 000 bribe for a R1million contract, under the pretence that he was the mayor. “It is alleged that the man pretended to be the municipality’s mayor and offered a woman a contract in which she will be paid more than R1million on condition that she pay R200000 in cash up front. “She was also promised to be the first lady after the deal was secured. The woman became suspicious and reported the incident to the police, after she was instructed to put the cash into a plastic bag and wait for further instructions at a taxi rank. “The police intercepted the suspect after he received the cash, which he had instructed the woman to place in a bin at the taxi rank. “The cash that he had received was recovered in his possession,” said Mbele.
