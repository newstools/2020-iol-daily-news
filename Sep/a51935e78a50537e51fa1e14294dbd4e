Durban - THE State was still opposed to a Pietermaritzburg man, accused of kidnapping and raping his neighbour, being granted bail despite being shown evidence that would change its stance, said the man’s attorney. The 34-year-old man appeared in the Pinetown Magistrate’s Court yesterday expecting to apply for bail. However, the State asked the court for more time to prepare. He was then taken back to the hospital section of Westville Prison. He was discharged last week from RK Khan hospital following a suicide attempt which saw him fall into a coma, unable to come to court. He had overdosed on schedule5 medication in holding cells at Hillcrest police station. Last Thursday, the case was adjourned after delays in bringing the man timeously to court. He is alleged to have kidnapped a 28-year-old woman in Pietermaritzburg on August 6. At the time, Daily News reported that the woman had opened the gate to her complex after thinking her that her dog had run out. Reaction Unit SA’s Prem Balram said a man called the woman to tell her that he knew where the dog was and offered to help find her. He allegedly bundled her into the vehicle and drove her to Hillcrest where he locked her in a room and raped her on more than one occasion. Yesterday, the man appeared before magistrate Gwendolyn Robinson. She granted the State’s application for an adjournment. The matter is expected to proceed next week. Daily News
