Durban - SEA Cow Lake residents are concerned about a proliferation of illegal dumping, which according to ward councillor Ashok Maharajh, has been escalating over the course of the past year. “It is picking up in a short space of time; members of the ratepayers’ association have informed me and we have been keeping a close eye on the issue.” Sea Cow Lake Ratepayers’ Association chairperson Wayne Govender said although there had been positive results in some areas by working with Durban Solid Waste, the biggest ­concern was near informal settlements where refuse accumulated to the point that it spilled into neighbouring roads. According to eThekwini Municipality spokesperson Msawakhe Mayisela, interventions had been put in place to deal with illegal dumping, but it remained a challenge “The city has ongoing educational programmes regarding illegal dumping. It should be noted that illegal invasion continues to be a challenge, and as a result illegal invaders will always dump. “This is despite us collecting refuse in more than 500 informal settlements in eThekwini. At all times, the city prioritises refuse collection but illegal dumping continues to be a moving target. ” S’bu Zikode, president of shackdwellers movement Abahlali baseMjondolo, contended that inequality in service delivery was a contributing factor to illegal dumping. “We only ask the municipality to provide residents with proper basic service on a consistent basis, which will encourage people to keep their community clean,” he said.
