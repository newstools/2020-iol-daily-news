Durban - THE trial of an Nquthu teacher accused of having sex with his pupils is set to begin in November, four years after his first appearance in the Nquthu Magistrate’s Court. He faces several charges including sexual assault and sexual grooming. He was charged in August 2016 after a video of him allegedly having sex with a school girl went viral on social media. The six charges against him relate to two victims, both of whom apparently lived with him in his cottage on school premises. The accused, who was a life orientation and arts and culture teacher at a high school, was 45 years old at the time of his arrest four years ago. What has been heard before court in the past was that the two alleged victims were from poor families, and the teacher got them to live with him under the pretence of lending a helping hand. One of the girls lived with the teacher from 2013 to 2015 and alleged that he began raping her in 2014. The court also heard that the teacher threatened to kill the girl and her relatives if she spoke out. “The matter is set down for trial on November 3,” National Prosecuting Authority spokesperson Natasha Kara said yesterday. It also emerged in court that the teacher had cases of attempted murder and being in possession of unlicensed firearms and ammunition pending when it was alleged he was found with four revolvers as well as 11 rounds of ammunition. Meanwhile, next month, a 44-year-old Phoenix teacher charged with statutory rape will appear in the Verulam Magistrate’s Court. According to police, the guardian of a 15-year-old became suspicious after finding a cellphone in the child’s possession with messages from the man. The victim has allegedly been raped since 2019.
