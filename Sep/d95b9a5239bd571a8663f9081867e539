Durban - KwaZulu-Natal Premier, Sihle Zikalala has visited the community on the south coast that has fallen victim of a serial killer recently to launch the provincial government’s 365-day campaign against gender-based violence. The campaign was preceded by a wreath laying ceremony where five women who were found dead in and around a sugar-cane field in Mthwalume in recent months. Afterwards, Zikala, accompanied by Transport, Community Safety and Liaison MEC Bheki Ntuli, Social Development MEC Nonhlanhla Khoza and SAPS KZN Commissioner Khombinkosi Jula visited the families of the victims. The visit follows another incident where the charred remains of a woman were found on a sugarcane farm on Saturday, in the same vicinity where the other bodies were found. However, it appeared to be an isolated incident. The delegation proceeded to visit the families of the five women that were found at the crime scene. “While the police have their own role to continue to investigate, we need to look at societal factors that are a cause of this situation. We need to work together with communities in an effort to bring back ubuntu (humanity), in effort to eliminate drugs and all criminal activities that are prevalent in the area,” said Zikalala. He said they also wished to express their condolences to the families who lost their loved ones and for that they wanted to express that they were going to be with them to ensure that they heal and regain the strength to continue with their lives. Zikalala also planned to meet stakeholders in the area, including the Community Policing Forum, community, religious and traditional leaders, to come up with a comprehensive plan to deal with the scourge of GBV. Zikalala had also received a comprehensive report from police authorities on the ongoing investigation into the murder of women in the area. Daily News
