Durban - THE government has initiated a comprehensive health study into the South Durban Basin area said Environment, Forestry and Fisheries Minister Barbara Creecy in response to a parliamentary question. “The draft terms of reference is being finalised and a service provider will be appointed to conduct the study,” she said. Creecy had been responding to National Freedom Party MP Ahmed Munzoor Shaik who asked why the department had never released a report by the University of KwaZulu-Natal of research into the high levels of pollution and its impact in the area. Creecy responded that it was unclear which research project Shaik was referring to. Unless the report was specifically commissioned by the department, it would not be able to release a report compiled by an institution not under its direct control and without its explicit permission. “The only work related to health studies conducted around South Durban Basin, which the department is aware of, was commissioned by the eThekwini Municipality under the auspices of the South Durban Multipoint Project title Multi Plan: Project4 - Health Study and Health Risk Assessment by Naidoo, et al 2006,” said Creecy. She said this research was conducted by UKZN for the municipality. The South Durban Community Environmental Alliance said the department’s failure to act swiftly to address the issues of South Durban has caused local authorities to act in bad faith. “The duty of local authorities is to enable meaningful delivery of the National Environmental Management Air Quality Act, co-operation between the municipalities, provincial authorities and national regulators is critical,” said Desmond D’Sa. He said there needed to be transparency. “Legislation such as the National Key Points Act has allowed government to withhold relevant environmental information from the public.” Daily News
